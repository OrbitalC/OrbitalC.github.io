description: "
  My research focus on the impact of finite temperature on the properties of materials.
  Notably, I’m interested by the impact of strong anharmonicity on the thermodynamical and transport properties of solids.  


  In order to decrease the cost of ab initio molecular dynamics, I developed during my PHD the Machine-Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling method, which uses machine-learning force-fields to sample the canonical distribution of a system with near ab initio accuracy."
